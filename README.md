## Corpus
For the corpus the 50 most popular western pop music if 2021 and the 50 most popular Korean pop (K-pop) music of 2021 will be used. I chose those as I am interested in both of these genres and I listen to them a lot. Therefore I am interested in the similarities and differences between sounds in these genres as K-pop is becoming more and more popular in western countries. I expect there to be differences in the tempo and danceability.

As the corpus makes use of the top 50 of 2021, of both genres I would argue that they represent both genres pretty well. One of the weaknesses of the corpus are that it makes use of a list not created by spotify itself. Therefore it may not be an absolute top 50. Another weakness may be that the western list is not only english based, but may also contain latin influences. One extra thing to mark is that some K-pop songs are collabs with western artist.

Some typical track from the western list are: "Bad Habits, Ed Sheeran", "Physical, Dua Lipa", "Stay, The kid laroi ft. Justing Bieber". Some typical K-pop tracks are "Dynamite, BTS", "I cant"t stop me, Twice", "SOLO, Jennie". These are typical songs as these are from some of the biggest artist in their respective genres.
